# Overview

This app was a trial run for a group project. My team learned Java and so we decided to increase our knowledge by attempting to create our own apps. This personal 
project began as a way to learn about andriod studio and how Java is used to create apps. Since the group project is a groceries app tracker, I chose to create a 
smaller and simpler version of the app that takes in items and their price to add to a grocery list. The list is shown on another screen with the total price along 
with taxes. So when the person heads over to the cashier, they know exactly how much they are paying for.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

For this mini project, I used Android Studio to create the base and Java for the app. It has a design view option for the code so I can see what changes are being 
made as I type them. It's helpful because I am still learning how to use Android Studio and take full advantage of its features.
